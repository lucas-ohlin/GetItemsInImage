# OpenCV-Items-In-Image
A Python project that uses OpenCV's template matching method to identify and count specific items within a given image.
<br><br>
It takes an "input image" and goes trough each image in the Images folder, it's fairly easy to change the images.<br>
All you need to do is replace the input image with something else in the code.
<br><br>
Note : Resolution plays a big part with OpenCV so might need to tweak the image sizes a bit incase you're having trouble.
## Libraries Used
